<p class="topic">The goal</p>
<p class="topicText">
The goal is to create a website that is close enough to a real webshop. This means that it has to be fully functional
with features that you wil normally see on any product selling website.<br>  
</p>
<p class="topic">Assignment</p>
<p class="topicText">
Create a website that has all of the code related topics we have touched upon during the semester.<br> 
</p>
<p class="topic">Disclaimer</p>
<p class="topicText">
Everyting you see on the website is fictional and we do not have any rights of images used. 
We do not own the images and furthermore not sell any real products. The whole website is a simulation of 
what a real webshop could have been.<br>
